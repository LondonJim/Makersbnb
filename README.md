###  Setup Instructions
```
$ git clone git@github.com:hjpugh/Makersbnb.git
$ bundle
```

#### Database

We used a cloud database solution, in our case we used ElephantSQL.

Once an account is made you will need to insert the following in to an .env file, which will need to be added to the root directory. The url is supplied by the database you have set up.

Example .env file

```
export URL_TEST="postgres://gThdgfjq:iGFhYUjWFc94ttnkuv7fD5GepIKZ9s1@dumbo.db.elephantsql.com:5432/gThdgfjq"

export URL="postgres://qhdgpsjh:1gshduHgCeGkHi923uhW57gha_KA1fCT@dumbo.db.elephantsql.com:5432/qhdgpsjh"

```
